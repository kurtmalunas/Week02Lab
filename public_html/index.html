	<h1>Beautiful Locations in Nier Automata</h1>
	<figure>
		<figcaption>The Amusement Park</figcaption>

	</figure>
	<p>"The Amusement Park is a location in NieR:Automata, encountered after 2B and 9S's fight with Adam in the Desert Zone. The pair were lured here by Simone, who had crucified a large number of androids with their black box signals still active.<br>The area also serves as the site of the God Box during the second half of the game. The Theater subsequently becomes unavailable for entry once 9S goes after the Park Access Key, as the structure ends up resting on the bridge."</p>

		<figcaption>Abandoned Factory</figcaption>

	</figure>
	
	<p>"The Abandoned Factory is a location in NieR:Automata, and the first area encountered in-game. The large industrial complex, once used for manufacturing the P-22 and P-33 model of robots, was converted for use by the machines, and serves as the site for several main story events."</p>
	
	<figure>
		<figcaption>Desert Zone</figcaption>
		<img src="photos/desert_zone.png" alt="desert_zone_nier">
	</figure>

	<p>"The Desert Zone is a location in NieR:Automata. Several bosses make their appearance here, including Hegel and the Emil clones.<br>
		Objects collected over the course of the game, along with data gathered by the researcher near the oasis, reveal that this was the area where Facade once stood. Its resident machines have taken to emulating the Masked People's (particularly the King's) style of dress and penchant for rules."</p>

	<figure>
		<figcaption>Tower</figcaption>
		<img src="photos/tower.png" alt="tower_nier">
	</figure>

	<p>"The Tower is a large structure made by the machines. It appears to be constructed from the same materials as the Copied City, and is supported by columns spread across the overworld. It emerges from underground in Chapter 11 and is the final destination players will encounter in NieR:Automata."</p>
	
	<figure>
		<figcaption>Kaine's Shack</figcaption>
		<img src="photos/kaine's_shack.png" alt="kaine's_shack_nier">
	</figure>

	<p>Kainé's Shack is an unmarked location in NieR:Automata. Encountered at the end of Emil's Memories is a repurposed shipping container that resembles the one Kainé used to live in during Nier's time thousands of year back, down to her grandmother's portrait in the same spot. Characteristic of the area are the dozens of Lunar Tears surrounding the shack. <br>After waking up from the collapsing platform and witnessing the death of 2B in Chapter 13, 9S may choose to return here and make a memorial grave for 2B.</p>

	<figure>
		<figcaption>City Ruins: Shopping Center</figcaption>
		<img src="photos/shopping_center.png" alt="city_ruins_shopping_center_nier">
	</figure>

	<p>The Shopping Center (also known as the Commercial Building or Shopping Mall) is a location in NieR:Automata. It is a relatively small location based on the remnants of a typical shopping mall constructed by humans. It contains several human-era items that can be found on the upper floor of the store and houses a secret underground area.</p>
